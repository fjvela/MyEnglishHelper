# My english helper

This application helps you improve your listening skills or practice your pronunciation by converting text to speech and speech to text. It is based on the code from https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk.

The application offers the following options:

- Text to Speech: Write a word, phrase, or convert a text file to speech (you can save the output as a WAV file)
- Speech to Text: Practice your pronunciation by speaking into the microphone and having the application recognize the text

To execute the application:
1. Create an Azure Speech Services account. (Note: A sentence was added for clarity)
2. Set up the appsettings.json file with the *region* and *subscriptionKey* values
